# Airbnb-Housing-Price-Guide-for-First-time-Hosts
Final Project for Analytics in Action course. 
Constructed prediction models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) for Airbnb lodging price for first-time hosts in Ottawa. 
Improved the modelâ€™s performance by 20% through data cleaning, feature engineering, and hyper-parameters tuning using cross-validation and grid search.

The baseline model is a linear regression model with no data transformation and feature engineering. 
The final models are the best performed model after tuning, the XGBoost model performed the best. 

Also includes a presentation slide desk used for final presentation at the end of the course.
